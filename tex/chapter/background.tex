While researching for previews attempts to classify bruxism, the scope was enlarged to include attempts to classify jaw movements in general.

76\% on grinding and 73\% on clenching detection accuracy achieved by \cite{bondareva2021earables} using earphones (eSense earables). 
94\% on chewing detection accuracy achieved by \cite{lotfi2020comparison} using earphones (eSense earables).
1\% to 4\% error rate on chewing detection accuracy achieved by \cite{lotfi2020comparison} using earphones (eSense earables).


 F1-scores on grinding up to 0.9 using around-the-ear EEG electrodes \cite{Knierim2021}
 
 87.6\% detection accuracy for face-related movements using barometer placed in earphones \cite{Ando2017}
 
 Reliable detection of up to 7 jaw-gestures using earphone speakers as microphones and recording vibrations propagated to the ear-canal \cite{Prakash2020}
 
 Recognition of 13 teeth tapping gestures with 90.9\% accuracy using custom-built ear-pieces with IMU on each side of the user jaw \cite{Sun2021}
 
 100\% detection accuracy of bruxism using EMG signals. \cite{Sonmezocak2021}
